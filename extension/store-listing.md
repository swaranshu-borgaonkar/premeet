Never lose context between meetings. Get 2-bullet summaries before every appointment. Works with Google Calendar.

## Detailed Description
Your professional memory, automated.

Every professional has the same problem: back-to-back meetings, scattered notes, and the constant fear of walking into a session unprepared. PrepMeet solves this by creating an unbroken thread of context across every client interaction.

**How it works:**

1. **Connect your calendar** — Google Calendar integration (Outlook coming soon)
2. **We detect your meetings** — PrepMeet identifies 1:1 appointments automatically
3. **5 minutes before** — You get 2 concise bullets summarizing your last interaction
4. **After each meeting** — Capture notes in seconds, voice or text
5. **The continuum grows** — Every meeting builds on the last, creating a permanent record

**What makes PrepMeet different:**

- **It's automatic** — No manual logging, no data entry. Just connect your calendar.
- **It's contextual** — Only shows what you need, when you need it: right before the meeting.
- **It's lightweight** — A Chrome extension, not another SaaS login to remember.
- **It works offline** — Perfect for travel, basements, hospitals, or anywhere with spotty connection.
- **It's privacy-first** — Your data stays encrypted. You own it. Export or delete anytime.

**Key features:**

🤖 **AI-powered context** — 2-bullet summaries from your session notes
📝 **Rapid note capture** — Add notes in seconds after each meeting
🎤 **Voice input** — Dictate hands-free (Individual plan)
✉️ **Email summaries** — Send recaps to attendees automatically (Individual plan)
📱 **Offline mode** — Full functionality without internet, auto-syncs when back online
👥 **Team workspaces** — Shared context, handoff notes, and team analytics (Team plan)
🔒 **Enterprise security** — SSO, audit logs, data residency, HIPAA readiness (Enterprise)

**Built for professionals who never have enough time:**

Whether you're a therapist with 8 clients daily, a lawyer juggling 4 consultations, a financial advisor reviewing portfolios, or a consultant tracking multiple engagements — PrepMeet ensures you never walk into a meeting wondering what happened last time.

**The continuum principle:**

Most tools treat each meeting as an isolated event. PrepMeet treats your professional relationships as what they are: an ongoing conversation. Every note adds to the thread, every interaction builds context, and over time, you build a complete picture of every client relationship.

**Save hours weekly, build deeper relationships:**

The average professional spends 3-5 minutes prepping per meeting. With 8 meetings daily, that's 40 minutes — over 160 hours yearly. PrepMeet eliminates that friction, giving you back weeks of productive time while helping you show up more present and prepared.

**Pricing Summary:**
- **Free:** 50 contacts, 30-day note history, basic prep
- **Individual ($9/mo):** Unlimited contacts, AI bullets, voice input, email summaries
